**Coffee Brew Log API — production‑ready minimum**

---

## Project Description

A minimal, production-ready REST API for tracking your coffee brewing journey.

This service allows you to log each coffee preparation, capturing details about every cup or recipe you try. Designed as
a personal brew diary, it helps you record, analyze, and revisit your favorite coffee experiences.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   npm install

2. Run in development mode:
   npm run dev

3. Build the project:
   npm run build

4. Start in production mode:
   npm start

## Scripts

- npm run dev — starts the server in development mode (hot-reload with nodemon + ts-node)
- npm run build — compiles TypeScript using esbuild
- npm start — runs the production server from the compiled dist/ folder
